# Learning to scrape and crawl

A repo to store the programs I wrote while learning to scrape static and dynamic websites. Dynamic websites have ajax calls which are performed by the browser and hence this data is not present in the page source and cannot be scraped using just scrapy or Bs4. We need headless browsers for that. 
One approach is PhantomJs with selenium. Learning that currently!
